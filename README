enc2ly is a Go tool that converts Encore files to LilyPond. It was
created using Felipe Castro's (fefcas@gmail.com) research and reverse
engineering by tweaking existing .enc files and loading them using the
4.55 demo version.


COMPILATION

* Install the Go compiler suite (see http://golang.org/doc/install)

* Then run

    mkdir /tmp/go 
    export GOPATH=/tmp/go
    go get github.com/hanwen/go-enc2ly

  /tmp/go/bin/go-enc2ly will then contain the program binary.
